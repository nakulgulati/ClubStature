            <h5><b>WHO WE ARE AND WHAT THIS IS</b></h5>
            Club Stature is a web-based application that helps individuals navigate their institute?s extracurricular opportunities.
            We take the private nature of your personal information very seriously, and are committed to protecting it. To do that, we've set up procedures to ensure that your information is handled responsibly and in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We're grateful for your trust, and we'll act that way.
            This privacy policy describes what information we collect when you visit Club Stature, how we use that information, and how you can access, update, and control it.
            
            <h5><b>TYPE OF INFORMATION</b></h5>
            "Personal information" is any information that we could use to identify an individual. It does not include personal information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public information.
            
            <h5><b>HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></h5>
            When we collect your personal information, we'll tell you how we're using it, any types of third parties to which we might disclose it, and the choices we offer you to limit the use of your information.
            Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when you are first asked to provide us with personal information, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and we'll notify you before we use the information for something other than the purpose for which it was originally collected. If anything in this policy seems unclear, please don't hesitate to contact us at clubstature@gmail.com, so we can address your question and possibly clarify your doubts.
            Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may occasionally need to change this policy. If we do update it, we'll notify you either by posting the new policy on ClubStature or by emailing you the changes or a link to the modified document. 
            Here are some of the ways we may use personal information you provide us:
            <ul>
                <li>To allow you to register for ClubStature through the Facebook login</li>
                <li>To communicate with you about our products, services and related issues</li>
                <li>To evaluate the quality of our products and services, and to enhance your experience on our web site</li>
                <li>To maintain and administer our web sites and comply with our legal or internal obligations and policies</li>
                <li>To transfer information to others as described in this policy or to satisfy our legal, regulatory, compliance, or auditing requirements</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <h5><b>Security</b></h5><p>All personal information is given confidential treatment at all times. We work hard to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of personal information. All such electronic information is stored on restricted database servers, and is generally kept until such time as you may ask us to edit or delete it, as described below. We comply with Facebook?s privacy policy as well.</p>
            
            <h5><b>Access</b></h5><p>Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the personal information we collect about you. Because personal information?for example, your email address?is required to use Club Stature, we retain personal information as long as your account is active. You will have the opportunity to correct, update, modify or delete this information updating your information in Club Stature.</p>
